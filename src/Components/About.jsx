        <h1>Welcome! I'm Abhi Setia</h1>
        <br></br>
        <h3>My mission is to help startup and SMEs with web services which are robust, sustainable, and ready to scale.</h3>
        <br></br>
        <p>Right now I'm sure you're wondering if you've found someone that's able to quickly integrate into your workspace and work well with the team.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>I've worked at startups and SMEs in my previous career for a little over two years and have been able to quickly integrate and contribute to corporate goals immediately. 
            Furthermore, I've spent three months, 12 hours per day learning full-stack development at Lighthouse Labs bootcamp. During the bootcamp, I learned to become proficient in Javascript, Ruby, HTML, CSS, ReactJS, NodeJS, jQuery, 
            Ajax, Sass, PostgreSQL, Mocha and Chai, Storybook, and linux. The only reason this was possible was because we spent the three months building real-world applications 
            with mentorship support. We were expected to write clean code and work in teams, as well as individually in order to simulate a real world working environment.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p> I believe by going through this experience and learning to quickly integrate into different environments and produce results immediately, I am able to save hiring costs
             for companies seeking a developer. </p>
